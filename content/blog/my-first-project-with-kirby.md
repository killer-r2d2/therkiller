# Launching My First Project with Kirby CMS: A Unique, Rapid Development Experience

I'm excited to share my latest project, [Inclousion.ch](https://www.inclousion.ch/), where I ventured into new territories with Kirby CMS, enhanced by the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS and the simplicity of Alpine.js.

## Introduction to the Project

This project marked my first experience with Kirby CMS. Kirby offers a flexible, file-based CMS that eliminates the need for a database, which intrigued me from the start. I decided to pair it with Tailwind CSS for styling and Alpine.js for the minimal interactive components, aiming for a lean and efficient tech stack.

## Development Experience

### Kirby CMS

Kirby's learning curve was steep yet rewarding. Its no-database, file-driven approach made it exceptionally straightforward to setup and deploy. The CMS's panel is intuitive, allowing me to manage content flexibly without relying on traditional database constraints.

## Lessons Learned and Conclusion

This project was an excellent first foray into using Kirby CMS. It provided a fast development cycle, thanks to the combined power of Kirby, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js. Each tool offered its unique strengths:

- **Kirby CMS** for its simplicity and flexibility in content management.
- **Tailwind CSS** for its speed and utility-first design philosophy.
- **Alpine.js** for its minimalist approach to adding interactivity.

Overall, this project not only enhanced my skills but also added a unique piece to my portfolio. For fellow developers considering this tech stack, I highly recommend diving in; it's well worth the learning curve!
