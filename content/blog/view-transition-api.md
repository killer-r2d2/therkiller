# Exploring the View Transition API and @view-transition

The View Transition API is a powerful tool for creating smooth transitions between different states of a web application. This blog post explores how the API works and how the @view-transition CSS property can be used to enhance user experience.

## Introduction to the View Transition API

The View Transition API is designed to make it easier for developers to create seamless transitions between different views or states in a web application. Traditionally, with technologies like PHP, transitioning between pages often required a full page reload, making smooth transitions difficult to achieve. The View Transition API provides a set of tools that allow for more control over animations and transitions, making it possible to create more engaging and dynamic user interfaces. For more details, you can refer to the [CSS-Tricks article on @view-transition](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/v/view-transition/).

## How to Use @view-transition

The @view-transition CSS property is a key part of the View Transition API. It allows developers to define custom transitions for different elements on a page, providing a more cohesive and polished look to web applications.

## Example

Here is an examples of how the View Transition API and @view-transition can be used in practice with the navigation:



```css
@view-transition {
  navigation: auto;
}
/* Create a custom animation */
@keyframes move-out {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }

  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

@keyframes move-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }

  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

/* Apply the custom animation to the old and new page states */
::view-transition-old(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-out;
}

::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: 0.4s ease-in both move-in;
}
```
